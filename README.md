# RayTracer
This is a simple ray tracer using the Phong lighting model developed to learn more about ray tracing and to practice programming in Java. This project will follow the concepts and pseudocode described in Gabriel Gambetta's Computer Graphics from Scratch along with attempting to implement the suggested improvements to the ray tracer mentioned at the end of the book.

# Pre-requisites
- I have developed this using Java 11.05.
- Intellij IDEA

# How to run
- Import project from existing sources
- Navigate to src/main/java/RayTracer.java
- Click the small run icon next to main
